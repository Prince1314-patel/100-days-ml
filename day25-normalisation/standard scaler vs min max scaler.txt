Min-Max Scaler
Definition: Transforms data by scaling each feature to a given range, typically [0, 1] or [-1, 1].

When to Use:

When you need features to be within a specific bounded range.
Suitable for algorithms sensitive to the scale of data, such as KNN and neural networks.
Useful when the data does not have outliers, as outliers can significantly affect the min and max values.
Example:
Original data: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Scaled data (range [0, 1]): [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]

Standard Scaler
Definition:Transforms data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, effectively standardizing the distribution of the data.

When to Use:

When you want to center the data and scale it based on variance.
Suitable for algorithms that assume the data is normally distributed, such as linear regression, logistic regression, and PCA.
More robust to outliers compared to min-max scaling, as it uses the mean and standard deviation.
Example:
Original data: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
Mean (
𝜇
μ): 6
Standard deviation (
𝜎
σ): 2.83 (approximately)
Standardized data: [-1.41, -0.71, 0, 0.71, 1.41] (approximately)
