DBSCan is a clustering based algorith which uses density to form clusters

In DBScan there are mainly two hyper parameters 1]Epsilon and 2]min_points

    1] Epsilon is the unit distance through which a circle is formed having radius epsilon (it can be 1mm,1cm etc.)
    2] min_points are the number of points required to be inside the circle to mark it as dense area 

There are three types of points in DBScan
    1] Core:- the point through which if we draw a circle then points falling in that circle should be greater than or equal to min_points
    2] Border:- the point through which if we draw a circle have less than min_points but having atleast 1 core point
    3] Noise:- the point which is neither a core point nor a border point

Desity Connected Points:- If two points are density connected points then we can simply form a cluster of that two points
        Two points are said to be density connected points if they are connected through a series of core points and distance b/w two core points is less than epsilon distance

How DBScan algorith works 
    Step 1 - Identify all points as either core point, border point or noise point
    Step 2 - For all of the unclustered core points
        Step 2a - Create a new cluster
        Step 2b - add all the points that are unclustered and density connected to the current point into this cluster
    Step 3 - For each unclustered border point assign it to the cluster of nearest core point
    Step 4 - Leave all the noise points as it is.
