Bagging v/s boosting

1] Type of model used
    In bagging we use fully grown decision tree which have low bias but high variance and boosting use shallow decision tree which has high bias and 
    low variance
2] Sequential V/S Parallel
    In bagging we form chunks of data from the original data and feed it to diffrent decision trees so this is a parallel training model, whereas in 
    Boosting we first train a single model and then train 2nd model while taking input from 1st model's error so this is a sequential training
3] Weightage of base learners
    In Bagging every model has same weights i.e that every model say will be accepted same, In boosting every model has diffrent weights so the model 
    with higher weight will have more say in output
