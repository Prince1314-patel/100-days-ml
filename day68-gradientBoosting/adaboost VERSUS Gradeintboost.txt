DIFFRENCE B/W ADABBOST AND GRADIENTBOOST

1] NO OF LEAF NODES
    In Adaboost me use the max_leaf_nodes of decisoion tree as 2 AND in Gradientboost we take 8 to 32 leaf nodes

2] LEARNIING RATE
    In Adaboost we assign weights to each model which generally tells the importance of each model and 
    in Gradientboost we assign learning rate to each model(learning rate for every model is same)
